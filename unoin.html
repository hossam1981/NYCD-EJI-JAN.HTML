      		LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the
          Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured
          hundreds
          of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information
          with black highlighters.
      		According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost
           invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible
            black ink that
           renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret
            highlighting
           policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

      		<h3>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will
          probably never know the particulars of several historic events,
          such as:</h3>
        </p>

     <lu>
      	<LI>	the Cold War</li>
      		<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
      	<li>	the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      </lu>
